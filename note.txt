Why should I use SmartNursing? Because:
- It is scalable: any number of rooms and patients can be handled
- It is reliable: the system is always active and ready to communicate
- It is extendible: new features could be implemented in the future
- About Security: the only access point from outside is the Telegram Bot, whose Security has been discussed
